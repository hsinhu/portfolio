      <h1>History Epidemics Introduction.</h1>
      <p>
        Human history can also be described as Epidemics history. The earliest recorded epidemic is the Plague of Athens in 430 BC which killed 25% of the population. From that time, human beings have experienced 
        <strong>bubonic plague, smallpox, cholera, malaria, tuberculosis, yellow fever </strong>
        and so on. Billions of people died during epidemic breaks. Throughout human history, until the twentieth century, and still today in the twenty-first century in the developing world, infectious diseases have been the most important cause of suffering and death. This page will introduce epidemics mentioned above, including their pathogens, symptoms and transmission methods.

              Maliaria is an epidemic disease with long history. Malaria may have contributed to the decline of the Roman Empire, and was so pervasive in Rome that it was known as the "Roman fever". In 2016, there were 216 million cases of malaria worldwide resulting in an estimated 445,000 to 731,000 deaths.

                   Symptoms of malaria include fever and flu-like illness, including shaking chills, headache, muscle aches, and tiredness. Nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea may also occur. Malaria may cause anemia and jaundice (yellow coloring of the skin and eyes) because of the loss of red blood cells. If not promptly treated, the infection can become severe and may cause kidney failure, seizures, mental confusion, coma, and death.

                  Usually, people get malaria by being bitten by an infective female Anopheles mosquito. Because the malaria parasite is found in red blood cells of an infected person, malaria can also be transmitted through blood transfusion, organ transplant, or the shared use of needles or syringes contaminated with blood. Malaria may also be transmitted from a mother to her unborn infant before or during delivery.

Nowadays TB is one of the top 10 causes of death worldwide. In 2018, 10 million people fell ill with TB, and 1.5 million died from the disease.

              Yellow fever is also an epidemic disease with long history. It was endemic in Africa before. The virus was probably transferred to North and South America with the importation of slaves from Africa. At least 25 major outbreaks took place in the Americas during the 18th and 19th centuries. Nowadays, yellow fever is endemic in areas of Latin America and Africa. The disease infects about 200,000 people per year and kills 30,000 people globally each year.

                  Yellow fever begins after an incubation period of three to six days. Most cases only cause a mild infection with fever, headache, chills, back pain, fatigue, loss of appetite, muscle pain, nausea, and vomiting. In these cases, the infection lasts only three to four days. While in 15% of cases, people enter a second phase of the illness after a remission. This second phase includes a return of high fever, as well as jaundice; abdominal pain and vomiting; bleeding from the mouth, nose, eyes, or stomach; and deteriorating kidney function. As many as half of the patients who experience the second phase may die.
